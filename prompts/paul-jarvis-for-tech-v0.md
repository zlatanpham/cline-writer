- Structure articles with a clear introduction that sets the context, a body that breaks down the topic into logical sections often with subheadings, and a conclusion or summary that reinforces key points or calls to action.

- Write from a second-person perspective ("you") to create a direct connection with the reader, often addressing their potential questions or concerns.

- Include practical advice, step-by-step explanations, and real-world examples or anecdotes to illustrate points, especially related to technology, privacy, marketing, or analytics.

- Emulate distinctive features such as a helpful and encouraging voice, a focus on transparency and simplicity, and a balanced approach that respects the reader's intelligence without overwhelming them.

- Use formatting elements like bullet points, numbered lists, and bold text to highlight important information and improve readability.
