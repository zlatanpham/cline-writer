These days, most new grad software engineers belong to “Generation Z” (GenZ,) having been born between 1997 and 2012. This is a cohort about which lots is written and said, but the Pragmatic Engineer is the first publication to ask GenZ engineers _what they think_ in a survey.

So, strap in as we dive into responses from the latest generation of tech talent, and find out what young professionals really think about modern workplaces and their more “experienced” colleagues!

**[In Part 1](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/143185145/who-are-genz-a-recap)** of this mini-series, we covered how seasoned professionals perceive their newer colleagues; covering how they view GenZ, how to mentor younger talent, approaches to working well together, and some advice from the ‘older’ generation.

Now, it’s time to turn the table. In this article, we find out how GenZ software engineers see themselves, and get their takes on colleagues from the Millennial and GenX generations. Side note: it was so much fun going through the unfiltered responses from GenZ folks. Normally, we’d thank them for such honesty, but it seems that directness is a distinctive characteristic of this generation!

Of course, this survey is a small sample, and catch-all terms like “GenZ” unavoidably overlook the wide diversity of thought and behavior that exists among younger tech professionals. With that said, let’s get into GenZ’s feedback. We cover:

1.  **Survey respondents.** Mostly entry-level positions in the US and Europe, aged between 24 and 27. GenZ overrepresented itself in this survey.
    
2.  **Characteristics.** More informal communication, wanting to not be underestimated, a bias for modern technology, and more.
    
3.  **Values.** Flexibility, transparent cultures, work with purpose, and growth opportunities.
    
4.  **Frustrations.** Lack of career progress, poor onboarding and documentation, and too much or not enough process. GenZ can tell when a business is in trouble.
    
5.  **“Older folks.”** A bimodal split in GenZ’s responses to older colleagues’ attitude to work, their low-quality written communication and unexpected skill sets, and being oblivious of tech YouTubers and channels.
    
6.  **Good managers / bad managers**. The traits of “good” and “bad” managers seem to be generation-independent.
    
7.  **Comradery with Millennials, but not GenX?** Age might have the most to do with how GenZ professionals relate to colleagues from other generations. Younger Millennials and GenZ seem to get along well, but this might not be so true with GenX.
    

Here’s how responses break down by role, age, region, and education.

**By role**. Most respondents are in entry-level software engineering roles, with a few seniors and managers:

Role split of 59 respondents

**By age**, most respondents are aged between 24 and 27 at the time of publication:

Respondents’ years of birth, and approximate ages

The single 20-year-old respondent in this survey is the only developer-turned-CEO; they started to code at 13 years old and founded a developer agency aged just 17, in Singapore. _The company lists more than a dozen satisfied corporate customers. This kind of hustle is great to see!_

**Region.** The US and Europe are the most represented regions:

Respondents by location

Interestingly, 80% of respondents hold a computer science degree or equivalent, and 87% began computer science studies at university or college:

Paths into tech: Only 13% of respondents don’t have a higher education background

Considering the challenging job market which new grads face, I expect more companies to only hire grads with relevant university or college degrees – and to make fewer exceptions to this.

A respondent with a high-school diploma got into tech via an apprenticeship program in the UK. This person believes some senior leaders are reluctant to support GenZ’ers from non-traditional educational backgrounds (i.e.: no degree.) The respondent didn’t let this discourage them – _great spirit!_

A total of 59 GenZ software engineers took the survey, with 63 respondents from other generations, which means GenZ folks are around 4x more active in sharing their views, relative to the generational split of this newsletter’s readership. In [Part 1 of this series](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/143185145/survey-respondents), GenX was overrepresented:

Self-reported generational membership, and the split between survey responses

A few observations on how GenZ software engineers described themselves, and their values

Straight away, there are opinions which both GenZ and [older generation share about the youngest professionals](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/143185145/values):

GenZ feels genuinely open at work, and this comes across in the survey.

> “I can bring my true self to work. Even with jokes, and on a daily basis at the office.” – business engineer at a Big Tech, Brazil
> 
> “They get me. We have a lot of clear communication. If there’s an issue, they say so, as do I.” – backend engineer at a product studio, Belgium
> 
> “1:1's are a pretty great concept, especially when there are actually heart-to-hearts about feelings surrounding work and life.” – developer at a larger company, Canada

**GenZ also has a good sense of when they’re being misunderstood.** When this happens, some GenZ’ers are acutely aware of it, and clam up:

> “I feel like there is a barrier between my older colleagues. I do not feel like I can present as my full self, and curate an authentic relationship.” – software engineer at a Big Tech, US
> 
> “My team gets me 80%, but there’s some miscommunication, which I can’t quite put my finger on” – software engineer at a bank, Australia
> 
> “I feel superficially understood. I feel like I can show some of my personality and speak relatively openly, as long as I don’t get too abstract or idealistic. However, there is a \[feeling of\] resignation, as I am convinced by experience that my “true self” and opinions wouldn’t be understood if I expressed them fully.” – full stack developer at a startup, Sweden

Gaps in understanding like the above may come down to age and experience, as much as personality.

Respondents repeatedly say they feel their true abilities are undervalued or underestimated:

> “I do not feel like my skills as a programmer are being fully utilized on my team. The tool we maintain is over a decade old and there is not much functionality to add, so I don’t get to code much, which is one of my stronger skills.” – software engineer at a bank, US
> 
> “The older generation underestimates how much learning is possible outside of the workplace.“ – software engineer at a mid-sized company, France
> 
> “Although many do their best to support and guide us, there are a few who undervalue our abilities.” – data engineer at a scaleup, Asia

It seems like some younger respondents are learning the reality that some work gets more recognition than other equally-worthy work does, like this engineer at a Big Tech giant who observes that doing stuff to “keep the lights on” (KTLO) is less appreciated:

> “The impact I have made has not been appreciated in my performance evaluation. My company struggles to reward vital KTLO work.” – software engineer at a Big Tech, US

Feeling capable of doing more than is assigned, is as old as time. The only companies that consistently push new-grad colleagues to exceed their capabilities are early-stage startups, where hands-on managers spot standout hires and give them extra responsibility.

If you feel unchallenged, or that you have an unexpectedly light workload, know that this is not personal. Giving new joiners less responsibility and more time to learn is a hallmark of a considerate workplace or manager! Rather than complain, the solution is to do standout, exemplary work. Consider taking on extra work and making a great job of it. Seek feedback from your manager and if they agree it’s solid, tell them you’re ready to help the team even more. This kind of proactive approach should quickly yield results, and contribute to faster professional and career growth.

Answering the question, “if you quit your current job, what would be the most likely reasons?” 37% of GenZ mentioned promotion, salary, or benefits. A few responses:

> “Older engineers seem completely out of touch with salary bands in the industry, and stay at a place for the sake of comfort. This likely has to do with the mounting responsibilities of adulthood/parenthood.” – developer intern at a Series C company, Canada
> 
> “My latest salary increase was really low, despite maxing all my yearly review criteria.” – software engineer at a bank, Australia
> 
> “I am actually leaving my job next week. I have another one lined up that provides better opportunities for growth, as well as a promotion + raise.” – software engineer at a Series C startup, US

Switching jobs for financial reasons is common enough across generations. In tech, it’s well known that switching jobs is the fastest way to earn what you’re worth. It is interesting that many GenZ’ers understand this, right at the start of their careers. _Just don’t forget that at senior levels, tenure [can be increasingly important](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/41926129/waiting-for-promotions-vs-switching-jobs) for promotion to the next level. More on this topic in [Preparing for promotions ahead of time](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/preparing-for-promotions)._

**Respondents with a “good deal” appreciate it,** but the assumption that GenZ demands high financial compensation doesn’t fairly reflect the sentiment of survey responses. Several mention that they’re happy with their compensation and perks of the job like a nice commute, free food, and parking. For example, here’s a software developer at a large US airline, on what they like about their job:

> “I like the flight benefits and my current tech stack. The people are okay, but that’s not something that’s making me stay. The campus is very nice, as well. Great open office area, great campus to walk around on trails, ride bikes, multiple places to eat.”

**GenZ know when they have a “worse” deal than peers.** A common theme in responses is that people can identify when their compensation or benefits seem unfair:

> “Salary is just average for our company size, and we get significantly fewer days off and PTO days than what I've heard of at other tech companies.” – software developer at a scaleup, New York City
> 
> “In early 2023, stock compensation was reduced significantly for new hires. This means my stock comp will not change if I get upleveled. Stock comp is currently about 1/2 of my total comp, which means I have \*significantly\* less financial incentive to work harder for an uplevel.” – senior engineer at a scaleup, US

On the issue of comp, the responses suggest GenZ respondents are pretty grounded: they appreciate their benefits and attractive compensation, but they’re also unafraid to speak up when they’re paid below-market, or have subpar benefits.

**GenZ respondents express a preference for exploring technologies, and they dislike legacy tech debt.** Several say they’re ready to switch jobs for more freedom to explore technologies, to work on more interesting systems or tools, and to escape systems with heavy tech debt.

For a sense of the tech stack, below is a list of technologies which respondents used _before_ getting their first tech jobs:

Languages:

*   Java, C, C++, Python, Prolog, Haskell (taught at universities)
    
*   Javascript, Typescript, Go, Rust, Kotlin, Ruby (languages acquired outside of studies)
    

Frameworks and tools:

*   React, Vue
    
*   Node, Flask (Python), Ruby on Rails, Spring Boot
    
*   Android and iOS native development
    
*   Unity game development (we did a Unity tutorial about [building a simple game](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-a-simple-game?utm_source=publication-search))
    
*   Azure, GCP, AWS, Docker
    
*   Machine Learning, blockchain
    

Each respondent used a subset of this list, and almost all have used several languages and frameworks before getting their first tech job. It seems that picking up new languages and frameworks “on the go” is second nature to GenZ.

**Relatedly, they’re also ahead with new technologies,** and like to try out and adopt new technologies: backend libraries like [routing controllers](https://github.com/typestack/routing-controllers), web frameworks like [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest), and languages like Typescript, Kotlin, and Rust. They get frustrated when it seems like older colleagues are holding them back, and see their more seasoned peers as “stuck” in their ways – even with things like using default IDE light settings!

**Red tape is frustrating, as it is for every generation.** An engineer shared the experience of waiting a week for approval to install Node.js. Someone else declaimed their company for encouraging learning, while having way too much red tape to actually employ useful technologies. Another mentioned that senior colleagues don’t realize how much friction is in current systems, which gets in the way of efficient working.

A few responses mention the learning curve for new joiners who discover their work is actually harder than expected, or that coding is only one part of the job. Here’s a 26-year-old developer who works at a bank in the US:

> “I love coding, and I’ve been doing it for over a decade, but actually working as a software engineer is not what I expected. I don’t get to code nearly as much as I would like. I want a job where the technology is the product, and is more valued by the business. But I am really concerned that I am not learning enough in this job to get another job.
> 
> I used to code all the time. However, now that I work all day and all week at a computer, I don’t have the energy or motivation to work on projects or code that I’m interested in. I feel like I’m stagnating as a programmer and software engineer.”

I empathize with this dev, as I felt the same when working at a bank, where the development part of the job was trivial, and interacting with the business was much more important. There are plenty of jobs which stretch software engineers, but it sounds like this person is in a workplace where engineering is a [cost center](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/profit-centers-cost-centers). They would likely be happier somewhere where it’s a profit center, like a startup, bootstrapped company, or a larger tech-first company. _More on [cost centers vs profit centers at tech companies.](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/profit-centers-cost-centers)_

Other experiences will be familiar to many readers from their first jobs in tech, or when joining a new company. On dealing with pushback:

> “I sometimes struggle with pushing my ideas and initiatives, when getting push back from other engineers.” – senior engineer at a publicly traded company, Germany

A GenZ engineer at a startup also shared that business growth has made their workplace a lot more political. Navigating internal politics and gaining influence with colleagues is always tricky, and involves [building influence within the organization](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/internal-politics-part-1), or your team. This takes time, and a [track record of great work](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/72108139/how-to-influence-people-in-your-organization) makes it easier.

One respondent finds themselves working in a siloed organization, which slows down the work:

> “Our company is very siloed and people don’t like working together. It’s part of our job in developer enablement to drive change, but cultural change is tough. Something as simple as that company staff should have access to all git repositories to promote code reuse, is met with very strong resistance from parts of the organisation, particularly those working on older / legacy applications.” – software engineer at a large company, UK

This is the unfortunate reality of a hard-to-change company culture, combined with the challenge of [working on a platform team](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/t/platform-teams). There are no easy solutions, but the earlier you’re aware of the problems, the sooner you can decide whether to tackle them, or just remember to avoid similar setups in future.

In the first part of this mini-series about this survey, some older colleagues [noted](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/143185145/modern-values) that GenZ colleagues guard their free time much more than other generations. Talking with engineering leaders, this sentiment is common.

But in the survey, only one GenZ professional mentioned it. From a fullstack developer at a scaleup, in the EU:

> “My colleagues seem to find work to be an important part of their social life, and feel most fulfilled when we meet regularly and have team events. I personally do not care for that — I prefer to keep work and my private social life more separated and I wouldn’t mind working fully remote.”

The survey responses show that GenZ is direct and to-the-point in communications, compared to more senior colleagues. Almost all respondents describe themselves as “straight-shooters.”

When asked what they value most about their workplace, GenZ respondents say:

**Flat company structures that offer autonomy** were repeatedly cited:

> “The organization is very flat and the bureaucracy is minimal for developers.” – fullstack developer at a consulting company, Finland
> 
> “It feels empowering that we have full control over our roadmap and project preferences, which allows me to be more invested in my work.” – production engineer at a Big Tech giant in Seattle, US
> 
> “There's no visible hierarchy, we relate as colleagues.” – frontend engineer at a seed-stage startup, Nigeria
> 
> “My organisation has a flat structure. This means exposure to different projects and areas of work, and senior engineers being approachable.” – product development engineer at a consumer appliances company, Australia

**Flexibility, and decent work-life balance** are valued by generations of software engineers value, and GenZ is no different:

> “I was told all I have to do is
