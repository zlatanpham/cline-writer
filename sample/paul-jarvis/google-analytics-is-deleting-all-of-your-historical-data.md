A few days ago, Google announced it would turn off all Universal Analytics services on July 1, 2024.

That means on July 1, you won’t be able to use or even see your UA data in Google Analytics, and worse, you won’t be able to export it.

Luckily, there’s still time to **save your Google Analytics UA data by importing it into Fathom Analytics**.

The best part? **We have forever data retention**. That means you can view your UA data on your Fathom Analytics dashboard forever.

What should marketers do?
-------------------------

Well, if you use Universal Analytics, you’ve got to [migrate to GA4](https://usefathom.com/learn/ga4-transition-guide) (and lose your UA data), [export your UA data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1038573?sjid=1016965049226798927-NC) into a CSV file, or simply [move to Fathom Analytics](https://app.usefathom.com/register) and run our straightforward GA importer.

Why did Google kill off Universal Analytics?
--------------------------------------------

Google’s track record for killing off popular software products is [well documented](https://killedbygoogle.com/). Many of their products, especially those they offer for “free,” are killed off, and their data is deleted forever.

With Fathom, our only product is analytics (meaning we wouldn’t kill it off). Since we charge a fair price to use our product, we’re sustainable enough to keep our service running indefinitely.

GA4 has not been well received
------------------------------

[There’s](https://twitter.com/Flamey_Fox/status/1689638367594696704) [been a](https://twitter.com/fullstackalien/status/1645456416327467008) [massive backlash](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/14fcidb/ga4_is_garbage_right/) [among marketers](https://twitter.com/ezsmith397/status/1671172161904713729) and [small business owners](https://twitter.com/TylerMKing/status/1675938306893180935) against being forced to use GA4. They say it’s too complicated, confusing, and barely usable.

Obviously, we’re heavily biased in our view that **Fathom is a better option than GA4**. However, we can also see the proof in the sheer number of new customers we’ve acquired who’ve tried GA4 and decided it wasn’t for them. People are [deleting their Google Analytics accounts](https://usefathom.com/learn/delete-google-analytics-account) in droves. The week UA stopped collecting new pageviews (last year) was easily one of the best new customer acquisition weeks we’ve ever seen. So it’s not just us who feel that GA4 isn’t working, spending months to learn; it’s the thousands of folks (or more) who’ve left Google for other analytics software.

There’s another (better way)
----------------------------

Website analytics should be simple and respect people’s digital privacy. That’s why we created Fathom, the best [Google Analytics alternative](https://usefathom.com/).
